# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Class Application Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not consistently applied. The issue appears to be random and doesn't always occur, making it difficult to debug.  The solution involves reviewing the order of CSS files, ensuring proper configuration, and verifying that the build process correctly integrates Tailwind.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the application (method depends on the framework used). 
4. Observe that some elements do not style correctly with Tailwind classes.

## Solution

The solution file contains updates to resolve the issue (see `bugSolution.js`). The cause might include improper configuration, incorrect build processes, or conflicting CSS.
